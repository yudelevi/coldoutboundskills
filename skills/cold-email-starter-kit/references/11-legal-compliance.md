# 11 — Legal Compliance

What you need to know about cold email law. Skim this before your first launch.

**Not legal advice.** This is a summary based on publicly available guidance. For your specific situation, consult a lawyer. If you're doing anything weird (healthcare, finance, EU consumers, anything above small-scale B2B), consult a lawyer before launching.

## CAN-SPAM (USA)

The US law governing commercial email. Penalties: up to **$51,744 per violation** (yes, per email).

### What CAN-SPAM requires

Your cold email MUST have:

1. **Truthful sender identity** — the "From" name and email must match a real person/organization. No "info@" from "John Smith."
2. **Non-deceptive subject line** — don't write "Re: your inquiry" if they never inquired.
3. **Identification as an ad** — can be implicit (the email itself makes clear it's solicitation), not explicit.
4. **Physical mailing address** — your real business address, or a PO box. Must be in every email.
5. **Unsubscribe mechanism** — a clear way to opt out, honored within 10 business days.
6. **Opt-out honored** — once someone unsubscribes, don't email them again. Ever. Applies across all your campaigns.

### What CAN-SPAM does NOT require

- Prior consent (unlike GDPR)
- Double opt-in
- B2B limitations (you can legally cold email businesses without consent)

### How to comply (in your email)

Every email should have a footer like:
```
— Jane Doe
Acme Inc, 123 Main St, Anytown, CA 94105

If you'd rather not hear from me, just reply "unsubscribe".
```

Or a hyperlinked unsubscribe:
```
Don't want these? [Unsubscribe]
```

Both Smartlead and Instantly can inject this automatically. Use it.

## GDPR (EU)

The EU data protection regulation. Much stricter than CAN-SPAM. Penalties: **up to €20M or 4% of global annual revenue.**

### The short version

**B2B cold email to EU recipients IS legal** under GDPR's "legitimate interest" clause, but only if:

1. **The email is relevant to their job role.** You can email a VP of Sales about sales tools. You cannot email them about car insurance.
2. **They can easily opt out.** Unsubscribe link in every email, honored immediately.
3. **You have a clear lawful basis** documented internally ("legitimate interest for B2B outreach about [your product category]").
4. **You respect their rights** — if they ask for data deletion, you do it.
5. **Your privacy notice is accessible** — link in email footer to your privacy policy.

### What GDPR prohibits

- **Emailing EU consumers** (personal addresses, gmail.com, hotmail.com, etc. when the person is in the EU and not in a business role). Hard no.
- **Buying lists** without documented lawful basis.
- **Hiding your identity** or using fake names.
- **Ignoring "right to be forgotten"** requests. When an EU recipient asks you to delete their data, you have 30 days to comply.

### DPO contact

If you send to EU recipients at scale, include a DPO (Data Protection Officer) contact email in your privacy policy. For small operations, your regular "legal@yourcompany.com" works.

## CASL (Canada)

Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation. Stricter than CAN-SPAM. Penalties: **up to CA$10M per violation.**

### Key difference from CAN-SPAM

CASL requires **consent** (express or implied). For cold email, you rely on **implied consent** from "business relationship" rules:

- **Implied consent (24 months)**: They're a published business contact (their email is on their company website, LinkedIn, etc.) AND your message is relevant to their business role.
- **Express consent**: Explicit opt-in — not applicable for cold email.

### How to comply (Canadian recipients)

1. Send only to published business email addresses (from public websites, not scraped personal addresses)
2. Your email MUST be relevant to their business role
3. Include unsubscribe link
4. Physical address in footer
5. Sender identity clear and truthful

### If in doubt

If you're unsure whether a Canadian recipient qualifies for implied consent, skip them.

## Other regions

- **UK (PECR + UK GDPR)** — same as EU GDPR for most practical purposes. B2B cold email is legal with legitimate interest; consumers are off-limits.
- **Australia (Spam Act 2003)** — requires "consent" which can be inferred from a business relationship or published contact. Similar to CASL.
- **Brazil (LGPD)**, **Singapore (PDPA)**, **India (IT Rules)** — various levels of strictness. If you're sending at scale in any of these, research the specific law.

## Unsubscribe requirements (summary table)

| Region | Unsubscribe required? | Honor deadline | Penalty |
|---|---|---|---|
| USA (CAN-SPAM) | Yes | 10 business days | $51,744/violation |
| EU (GDPR) | Yes | Immediately | €20M or 4% revenue |
| Canada (CASL) | Yes | 10 business days | CA$10M/violation |
| UK (PECR) | Yes | Immediately | Up to £500K |
| Australia (Spam Act) | Yes | 5 business days | AU$2.2M/day |

**Practical rule:** honor all unsubscribes within 24 hours. That's safer than any legal minimum.

---

## Physical address requirement

CAN-SPAM, CASL, and some EU rules require a physical mailing address in every email.

**Options:**
- Your actual business address (if you're comfortable publishing it)
- **A PO box** ($10-30/month from USPS)
- **A virtual office / mailbox** — iPostal1 (~$10/mo), Earth Class Mail (~$20/mo), Anytime Mailbox (~$10/mo)

Don't skip this. It's the easiest violation to catch.

## Never do this

1. **Don't email a purchased list from a random seller.** Prospeo/Apollo/etc. are clean. "LeadMine Pro" for $99 is scraped trash that will burn your domain and get you sued.
2. **Don't email consumer addresses in the EU.** Not debatable. GDPR will ruin your day.
3. **Don't email minors.** Check your list filtering for .edu domains at universities that still use student emails.
4. **Don't email government addresses (.gov, .mil).** Some agencies will forward you to their IT department with very unpleasant consequences.
5. **Don't scrape Facebook, Instagram, personal Twitter, or TikTok for emails.** Terms of service + privacy laws.
6. **Don't email healthcare providers about patient data.** HIPAA has its own layer.
7. **Don't use auto-bcc to your boss** — if they're in the "To" field unexpectedly, it looks like a marketing violation.
8. **Don't spoof From addresses.** Use the same domain you own.
9. **Don't use AI to bypass unsubscribe.** Unsubscribe means forever.
10. **Don't miss a physical address.** This is the #1 violation fine.

## Your pre-launch legal checklist

Before your first campaign ships, confirm:

- [ ] Sender name is real
- [ ] From email matches sending domain
- [ ] Physical address is in footer (real or PO box)
- [ ] Unsubscribe link/reply instruction is in every email
- [ ] Privacy policy exists and is linked (if sending to EU/UK)
- [ ] Your list is from a legitimate source (Prospeo, Apollo, Blitz, Clay, LinkedIn scraper you own)
- [ ] You're not emailing consumer addresses in GDPR regions
- [ ] You're not emailing .gov / .mil / .edu
- [ ] Your block list is wired up and honors unsubscribes across campaigns
- [ ] You have a process to honor "right to be forgotten" requests within 30 days

If all checked: ship.

## If you get a complaint

1. **Stay calm.** Most complaints are non-escalating.
2. **Respond within 24 hours** acknowledging receipt.
3. **Remove them from all campaigns immediately.**
4. **Document** the complaint and your response.
5. **If they threaten legal action:** stop responding, consult a lawyer.

Most "unsubscribe or I'll sue" emails are noise. But some are real. Take every one seriously.

## When to consult a lawyer

- You're sending > 100K emails/month
- You have EU / UK recipients
- You're in healthcare, finance, insurance, or legal
- You received a cease & desist
- You're considering a purchased list
- You're unsure about anything above

Lawyers are cheap compared to CAN-SPAM fines. A one-hour compliance review before your first campaign is worth $400-800. Pay it if in doubt.
