# 00 — Getting Started

Start here if you've never sent a cold email before. This file walks you through accounts, API keys, `.env` setup, cost, and your first verification.

## Is this for you? (3-question screener)

1. Do you have a product or service to sell?
2. Do you have ~$200 for the first month?
3. Do you have 60 minutes of focused time?

If yes to all three, keep reading.

## Technical prerequisites

### Node.js 20+
Check your version:
```bash
node --version
```
If it prints `v20.x.x` or higher, you're good. If not:
- **macOS**: `brew install node`
- **Linux**: use `nvm` (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), then `nvm install 20`
- **Windows**: download installer from nodejs.org

### tsx (TypeScript runner)
```bash
npm install -g tsx
```
Verify: `tsx --version`

### A terminal
If you've never opened one: macOS Terminal.app, or Windows Terminal, or iTerm2.

### A text editor
Any will work. VS Code is free and recommended: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Optional: `dig` for DNS verification
Already installed on macOS and most Linux. On Windows, install BIND utilities or use `nslookup` as a fallback.

## Accounts you need to create

### 1. Dynadot (domain registrar)
**What it does:** Buys throwaway domains for you programmatically.

**Signup:** https://www.dynadot.com/account/signup.html

**After signup:**
1. Top up your wallet with at least $100 (Tools → Account → Add Funds)
2. Go to **Tools → API**
3. Click "Enable API Access" and copy your API key
4. **Critical:** Whitelist your current IP address (find yours at https://whatismyip.com). Dynadot refuses API requests from un-whitelisted IPs.

### 2. Zapmail (inbox provider)
**What it does:** Hosts your sending inboxes, sets up SPF/DKIM/DMARC automatically, exports to Smartlead/Instantly.

**Signup:** https://zapmail.ai/

**After signup:**
1. Go to **Settings → API**
2. Copy your API token

### 3. Prospeo (lead source)
**What it does:** Searches a 200M+ B2B contact database with filters.

**Signup:** https://prospeo.io/

**After signup:**
1. Buy starter credits (~$49 for 1,000 credits = ~1,000 contacts)
2. Go to **Dashboard → Integrations → API**
3. Copy your API key

### 4. Smartlead OR Instantly (pick one)

#### Smartlead (recommended for beginners)
**Signup:** https://app.smartlead.ai/auth/sign-up
- 14-day free trial
- Basic plan ~$39/mo for 2,000 leads
- API key: **Settings → API Keys → Create new**

#### Instantly (more features, bigger API)
**Signup:** https://app.instantly.ai/signup
- 14-day free trial
- Growth plan ~$37/mo for 1,000 leads
- API key: **Settings → Integrations → API Keys → Create**

You only need one of these. You can try both free trials and decide.

## Setting up the `.env` file

In the skill root, copy the template:

```bash
cd <repo>/skills/cold-email-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env   # or create .env manually
```

Open `.env` in your editor and fill in the keys you just collected:

```env
# ── Domain registrar ─────────────
DYNADOT_API_KEY=

# ── Inbox provider ───────────────
ZAPMAIL_API_KEY=

# ── Lead source ──────────────────
PROSPEO_API_KEY=

# ── Sending platform (fill in ONE) ──
SMARTLEAD_API_KEY=
INSTANTLY_API_KEY=

# ── Enrichment (optional, leave blank for now) ────
BLITZ_API_KEY=
BLITZ_BASE_URL=https://api.blitz.us
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
RAPIDAPI_KEY=

# ── Your sending identity ────────
SENDER_FIRST_NAME=Jane
SENDER_LAST_NAME=Doe
SENDER_EMAIL_PREFIX_1=jane
SENDER_EMAIL_PREFIX_2=janedoe
DEFAULT_REPLY_TO_EMAIL=jane@yourmaindomain.com

# ── Physical address (for email footer, CAN-SPAM compliance) ────
COMPANY_STREET=123 Main St
COMPANY_CITY=Anytown
COMPANY_STATE=CA
COMPANY_ZIP=94105
COMPANY_COUNTRY=USA
```

**NEVER commit `.env` to git.** If you're in a git repo, add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately.

## Verify your setup

From the skill root:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-credentials.ts
```

Expected output:
```
Service       Status  Notes
Dynadot       ✅      Wallet: $127.50
Zapmail       ✅      0 domains, 0 inboxes
Prospeo       ✅      1000 credits
Smartlead     ✅      0 campaigns
Instantly     ⚠️       Not configured (optional)
```

If any row is ❌:
- **Dynadot**: Is your IP whitelisted? Check https://whatismyip.com vs Dynadot Tools → API settings
- **Zapmail**: Verify the token in Settings → API
- **Prospeo**: Confirm credits are loaded, try regenerating the key
- **Smartlead/Instantly**: Make sure you picked the right env var for the platform you signed up for

Once everything is green, you're ready to launch your first campaign. Open `references/14-60-minute-tutorial.md` for the step-by-step walkthrough, or `references/01-deliverability-fundamentals.md` if you want to understand why we're doing all of this first.

## Your first "hello world"

Before spending any money, try a zero-cost test:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/dynadot-generate-domains.ts --brand test --count 10 --check-only
```

This generates 10 candidate domain names and checks Dynadot for availability. No purchase. If you see a list with prices, everything's wired correctly.
